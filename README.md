> Minifile is a node CLI tool for minifying files within your project by removing comments and additional spaces. This will also generate a new folder with your newly minified files in it.

## Install

```sh
npm install @heyosj/minifile -g
```

## Running Minifile

<p> To minify files call the package with keyword `minify` with the path to where the original file is located </p>

```sh
minify ./myprojects-files/originalJS.js
```

<p>Once the command is ran this will create a folder named `minified-files` that will include the name of your original file but with a `.min` included. From there you can link to it as you normally would with the original files</p>
